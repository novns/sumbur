# Sumbur

This project is an example of a personal blog website built with [atreugo](https://github.com/savsgio/atreugo)
([fasthttp](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp) and [router](https://github.com/fasthttp/router) inside),
[quicktemplate](https://github.com/valyala/quicktemplate) and some other Go libraries.

It uses PostgreSQL for storage and Redis for sessions.


## Purpose

The goal of this project is to increase the entropy of the Universe.

I have created it for my own website and decided to share the code.


## Usage

Clone or fork it and modify to your needs.


## TODO

* Remove greasy Bootstrap and jQuery things
* Some paging would be nice
* Where are Atom and RSS?
* Offer the blueprint for blueprinting here and there
